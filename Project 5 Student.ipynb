    "In this project, we use natural language processing techniques to explore a dataset containing tweets from members of the 116th United States Congress that met from January 3, 2019 to January 2, 2021. The dataset has also been cleaned to contain information about each legislator. Concretely, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocess the text of legislators' tweets\n",
    "* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis of the text\n",
    "* Use sentiment analysis to explore differences between legislators' tweets\n",
    "* Featurize text with manual feature engineering, frequency-based, and vector-based techniques\n",
    "* Predict legislators' political parties and whether they are a Senator or Representative\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore two questions that relate to two central findings in political science and examine how they relate to the text of legislators' tweets. First, political scientists have argued that U.S. politics is currently highly polarized relative to other periods in American history, but also that the polarization is asymmetric. Historically, there were several conservative Democrats (i.e. \"blue dog Democrats\") and liberal Republicans (i.e. \"Rockefeller Republicans\"), as measured by popular measurement tools like [DW-NOMINATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)#:~:text=DW\\%2DNOMINATE\\%20scores\\%20have\\%20been,in\\%20the\\%20liberal\\%2Dconservative\\%20scale.). However, in the last few years, there are few if any examples of any Democrat in Congress being further to the right than any Republican and vice versa. At the same time, scholars have argued that this polarization is mostly a function of the Republican party moving further right than the Democratic party has moved left. **Does this sort of asymmetric polarization show up in how politicians communicate to their constituents through tweets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the U.S. Congress is a bicameral legislature, and there has long been debate about partisanship in the Senate versus the House. The House of Representatives is apportioned by population and all members serve two year terms. In the Senate, each state receives two Senators and each Senator serves a term of six years. For a variety of reasons (smaller chamber size, more insulation from the voters, rules and norms like the filibuster, etc.), the Senate has been argued to be the \"cooling saucer\" of Congress in that it is more bipartisan and moderate than the House. **Does the theory that the Senate is more moderate have support in Senators' tweets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: See the project handout for more details on caveats and the data dictionary."
